######################### Description of the version ##########################

This version upgrades V-3.6. So all the features of V-3.6 includes here along with new features those
are implemented here as below-

1. Battery voltage determination in case of low battery indication is modified to maintain integrity.

N.B. - This version includes URC checking function through UART port scanning but URCs are coming in main UART
       so there is a chance of mixing URCs with command data. URCs should come from different UART which is not 
       modified in Hardware till now.
