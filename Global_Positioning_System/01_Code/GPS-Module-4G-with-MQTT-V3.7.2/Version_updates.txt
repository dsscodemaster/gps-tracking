######################### Description of the version ##########################

This version upgrades V-3.7. So all the features of V-3.7 includes here along with new features those
are implemented here as below-

1. Battery's operational voltage range extended by additional hardware circuit and co-responding changes
in firmware to read the current voltage level and set battery percentage according to extended voltage range.

2. Checking of battery voltage from different analog pin. Previously it was modem voltage supply pin that to read
for remaining voltage percentage, now battery volatge pin is connected with a ADC pin of modem and controller reads
that pin for current battery voltage level.
